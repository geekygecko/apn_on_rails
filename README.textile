h1. APN on Rails (Apple Push Notifications on Rails)

I have turned over the reigns of APN on Rails to the good people @ PRX (Public Radio Exchange). 

You can find the OFFICIAL for at:

h3. Thank You

I would quickly like to say thank you to everyone who has supported this project, but due to other priorities in my life, I just don't have time to keep up with the demands of this plugin. I know the great folks @ PRX will do a great job maintaining APN on Rails.
